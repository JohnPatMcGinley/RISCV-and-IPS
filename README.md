# RISCV-and-IPS

This github page was created to display work done regarding benchmarking with the Intel Parallel Studio VTune profiler, as well as benchmarks related to OpenMP and parallelization with bitonic sort. It includes screenshots and source files for relevant benchmarks. All benchmarking was performed in an Ubuntu distribution of Linux with the following system specifications https://gyazo.com/f50b99623fea79a69288c1a88eb6db67

It also contains hello comparisons, which is a folder with .lst files generated from two versions of a classic hello world example, one compiled with gcc and the other with riscv64. This was done to demonstrate the smaller size of the riscv64 .lst file as compared to the gcc file.
